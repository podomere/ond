This license and requirements for exemption apply recursively from this root
node down through all forms of content unless otherwise and explicitly stated
on a per node, component, sub-component, or unit of content (default is
recursive unless otherwise stated). From here on all content, data,
intellectual property and information that can be and is represented or
recorded by symbols, symbolic logic, or symbolic reference shall be referable to
as Software for the purposes and applicability of The MIT License
http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

Intent: All employees, agents, contractors, or contributors grant Podomere a
non-exclusive full and unrestricted license, as laid out in this text, to their
output in direct relation to their engagement or undertaking whilst contracted
to Podomere. Basically the labour grants the license to the organisation rather
than the organisation assuming the license.

All content and intellectual property, unless clearly marked with or created
under an explicit restrictive license per project or engagement, and
notwithstanding an original author's asserted license, a client or individuals
rights, Company Confidential, or Commercial in Confidence; is covered by the
The MIT License (MIT), Copyright (c) 2013, http://podomere.com Donal O Duibhir, 
Founder of Podomere Pty Ltd. http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

All employees, agents, contractors, and contributors are bound to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of clients or agents data and intellectual
property in a professional and ethical way including adhering to the laws,
regulations, and statutes applicable in said territories or situations.

Rationale: We want to do for organisations what the MIT license has done for
Free and Open Source Software yet retain the right to selectively (rather than
in a blanket manner) choose which projects, products, services, and intellectual
property is protected in other fashions. This then puts the onus on clarity
of purpose and transparency at all times. The intent is to allow employees,
agents, contractors, and contributors to, by default grant a non-exclusive,
non-expiring, full set of rights to the output of their Podomere contracted
labour (only whilst engaged by Podomere) and associated intellectual property
or invention created during and in the fulfillment of said engagements; to
Podomere such that the original author retains non-exclusive rights to said
intellectual property or process unless otherwise agreed.

In summary, an employee, agent, contractor, or contributor has to manually
opt-in by or on request of Podomere to Podomere's organisationl copyright.
Podomere will have to explicitly ask said actor or agent to physically or
digitally sign an agreement on a per engagement, project, or deliverable basis
to protect any form of organisational copyright including but not limited to;
trade secrets, processes, products, services, know-how, invention, content or
any other form of intellectual property (not withstanding exclusions noted
above in relation to an original author's license, Company Confidential, or
Commercial in Confidence requirements). This also ensures separation of duty
and clarity of scope when entering in to any labour agreement.
