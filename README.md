Open Network Design

Repository for FLOSS network, systems, and infrastructure related designs. Please use markdown and a minimum of both an optimised for web image **and** its associated editable source file in .svg, .uml (or if necessary .graffle or .vsd). Such that the file size limits on github apply in this repo, please use simple shapes, lines and text to keep your diagram file sizes under 10MiB. This will also have the byproduct of removing vendor bitmaps and colours on complex diagrams forcing the authors to rethink how to convey meaning in black and white simplicity.

As always, please share, comment, contribute in a helpful manner where critiscism is constructive. Collaboration and community is key. Energy flows.
