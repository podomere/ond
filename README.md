Open Network Design

Repository for FLOSS network, systems, and infrastructure related designs. Please use markdown and a minimum of both an optimised for web image **and** its associated editable source file in .svg or .uml (or if necessary .graffle or .vsd). Such that the file size limits on github apply in this repository please use simple shapes, lines, and text to keep your diagram file sizes under 10MiB. This will also have the byproduct of incentivising the removal of vendor bitmaps and colours on complex diagrams forcing the authors to rethink how to convey meaning in black and white simplicity. If you can not diagram with simple and standard shapes then perhaps you are not modelling for the widest audience possible (which is in fact a goal i.e. both technical and non-technical audiences).

As always, please share, comment, contribute in a helpful manner where critiscism is constructive. Collaboration and community is key. Energy flows.
