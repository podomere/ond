## Goals
* To effectively manage existing and future network platforms logs (and related elements).
* To ensure expedient and reliable transport and storage of emitted logs
* To detect, respond to, and restore services due to faults and failures
* To expedite the correlation and root cause analysis of faults across the IT footprint
* To diminish MTTR->0 and increase MTBF->∞
* To base decision making upon empirical evidence.
* To enact and enable continual Service Improvement.

## Background 
By virtue of providing a network fabric (thus a service platform to the whole business) it is incumbent upon operations and engineering teams to manage all network resources not just individually, but as an aggregate, and as effectively as possible to ensure a reliable, predictable, and efficient service is provided. This entails standard network and security logging from elements for a wide array of events, triggers, and informational aspects. A key part of operations is situational awareness and without proper instrumentation and logging from devices, one might as well be flying blind.

## Out-of-Scope
* Amazon VPC (vGW, iGW)
* Teleworkers Cisco 881
* Anything not explicitly listed "in-scope".

## Assumptions
* All network elements will be reachable from their management control plane interfaces (either in-band via loopbacks or dedicated management interfaces)
* All network elements will provide a reachable layer 3 interface across a management zone or primary data path from a centralized sensor per region (AMER, EMEA, APAC)
* All network elements will require their CPU, memory, storage, and environmental thresholds to be logged when exceeded to generate alerts based upon said pre-defined thresholds
* Fundamental/basic monitoring and trending is required across all network assets to establish normal patterns and to help facilitate capacity management
* The logging platform will run on linux or a *nix derivative 
* The logging platform and sensors may be run in a VMWare virtualised environment
* regional collectors are expected to be available. 

*Note:* The following requirements will focus primarily upon the format, content, style, configuration, and handling of emitted logs. The network team will emit all logs (where capable) as RFC5424 syslog compatible formats with Facility Code 23 (local7) and Severity Code 5 (notifications).
 
*Note:* The header of the Syslog message contains “priority”, “version”, “timestamp”, “hostname”, “application”, “process id”, and “message id”. It is followed by structured-data, which contains data blocks in the “key=value” format enclosed in square brackets “[]”.
