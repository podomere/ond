# Design Guidelines

## Client Side Requirements
- One to three devices per attendee (all manner of smartphones and laptops)
- 2.4 GHz and 5GHz support
- Minimum RSSI -67dBm / SNR 25dB in coverage areas
- Minimum 5/5Mbps throughput to maximum 20/20mbps
- Application traffic types are primarily miscellaneous web browsing
- HD video conferencing and voice should be available and prioritised
- Sub 5ms response from default gateway
- Sub 5ms response from cached DNS entries
- Multicast and local client to client connectivity not supported except in smaller spaces
- Limited wired connections of 100/100Mbps for all speakers and those wanting to do live demos.

## RF and WiFi Configuration Related
- MCA(Multi-Channel Architecture) which rules out Meru!
- Distributed WiFi micro-cell architecture (rules out Xirrus!)
- Overhead directional 'patch' antennas
- 2.4GHz 'event-legacy' and 5GHz 'event' ESSIDs (throughout)
- ESSID's anchored to major spaces (named accordingly vs. full site roaming if sticky issues)
- Limited layer 2 roaming (just to help keep broadcast segment size down)
- 20MHz only channel widths for maximum spectrum re-use and clean air
- 802.11g/n only (802.11ac in some locations but not required as SNR~30dBm for 256QAM!)
- Basic (i.e. mandatory) 18 or 26Mbps data rates and *above* only (see [http://mcsindex.com](http://mcsindex.com) )
- Predictive modelling/full survey but mandatory post-validation survey
- SNR to 25dB in all expected coverage areas
- Full WIPS dedicated APs and mobile spectrum analyzers
- 802.11k (and/or proprietary load balancing in mini-radio clusters in super dense client areas)
- Careful use of RX-SOP (if available ;)

## Wired Backbone and Event Data Services
- Minimum dual active/active 10Gbps ISP transit links via disparate vendors/metro rings (with ability for vendors/exhibitors to terminate their own feeds)
- Minimum 40Gbps+ capable edge routing/firewalling
- 10Gbps dual redundant access edge uplinks to distribution
- Full 20-40Gbps or more primary campus backbone/infrastructure to the CORE
- N+1 redundant architecture throughout as far as the access/edge and APs
- Well architected L3 domains (to partition and minimise L2 failure domains)
- Routers should route and firewalls should firewall, thus DNS and DHCP should be provided for via dedicated servers or appliances 
- DHCP lease time minimum of 1 day with very large scopes to avoid exahaustion and excessive broadcasts
- Software caches and/or major CDN edges onsite
- Local redundant / Anycast DNS resolvers and/or caches (i.e. not performed on routers/FWs)
- Dedicated physical links and paths (where possible) for exhibitors/vendors and/ or workshops or labs.
- L7 Application Visibility / DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and associated shaping/throttling or queuing to a scavenger class for known bandwidth hogs
- Optional per-client SRC IP / bi-directional rate limiting

## NetOps / SecOps and Customer Service
- A full NoC (Network Operations Centre) that also engages attendees via locally hosted status pages and other social media channels i.e. Twitter etc..
- All digital signage giving informative and constant network info/updates
- Constant and distributed monitoring via humans/sensors/APs to adjust for a growing noise floor and to track down any 'evil twin' APs or strong rogues
- Full Network Management, Capacity Management, Alerting etc.
- Technically qualified roaming volunteers to assist attendees get connected including at event hubs and booths

*Note:* This is just a mixed flavour of some high and low level critical design elements (of course more explicit requirements should be created and customised with respect to <EVENT> specific functional and non-functional requirements including proper design documentation etc.). There is no escape however from doing simple maths with respect to the number of supported CAM table and ARP entries per infrastructure device and factoring things like the TCP set up per second and concurrent NAT sessions at layer 3 boundaries (if you don't have publicly routable IP space)... also.. know your clients i.e. do some capacity planning in advance!
