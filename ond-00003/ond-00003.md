# Requirements

**Tools:** straight through ethernet cable and straight through serial cable with A end RJ45 (B end to usb or DB9 depending on user computer)
**Tips** If this not a factory shipped device then please backup or create a rescue configuration before you begin i.e. don't blow away the current configuration fully in case you need it later. Please perform the steps up until Step 5. on both devices.

## Step 1.
Please note that both devices will have to start from factory defaults or alternatively ```request system zeroize``` and have ge-0/0/7 connected back-to-backon each device, and have switching disabled before being brought in to cluster mode (which we will address further down anyway ref: [https://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos-security/junos-security10.2/junos-security-swconfig-security/topic-43896.html](https://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos-security/junos-security10.2/junos-security-swconfig-security/topic-43896.html)).

Take a moment to review the SRX cluster node default port allocations: [http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos12.1/topics/reference/general/chassis-cluster-srx-series-node-interface-understanding.html](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos12.1/topics/reference/general/chassis-cluster-srx-series-node-interface-understanding.html)

## Step 2.

Power on. Connect computer ethernet to any port other than ge-0/0/0 (i.e. ge-0/0/1-6 for an SRX220). If this is an already configured device then go to EDIT mode and ```load factory-default``` and ```commit```. Also, you may need to ```run request system storage clean-up``` to make space for a new image if upgrading/downgrading. From the serial cable ```set system root-authentication plain-text-password <CR>```.

## Step 3.

Grab the serial numbers for asset management ```run show chassis hardware``` and enable gi-0/0/0:
```
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ssh
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services dhcp
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ping
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1
```
Then from your local host or elsewhere (optional) upload your preferred and JTAC recommended image as per [http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB21476&smlogin=true](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB21476&smlogin=true):
```
scp junos-srxsme-11.4R7.5-domestic.tgz root@192.168.1.1:/var/tmp
```
Check the MD5 signature on all software before installing on any device. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP. On the destination SRX:
```
file checksum md5 /var/tmp/junos-srxsme-11.4R7.5-domestic.tgz
```
The checksums must match otherwise you will brick the device… good luck with that…
```
root> file checksum md5 /var/tmp/junos-srxsme-11.4R7.5-domestic.tgz
MD5 (/var/tmp/junos-srxsme-11.4R7.5-domestic.tgz) = fe4a909941d5d899d6997f9b75c4e0f0
```
Then install to the system:
```
run request system software add /var/tmp/junos-srxsme-11.4R7.5-domestic.tgz
```
And optionally allow it to do the validate option (no harm) as some use:
```
run request system software add /var/tmp/junos-srxsme-12.1X44-D11.5-domestic.tgz no-copy no-validate
```
Then ```run request system reboot```.

## Step 4.

Remove all the spurious stuff not needed which must be removed for clustering:
```
delete vlans
delete interfaces vlan
delete security zones security-zone trust interfaces
delete security zones security-zone untrust interfaces
delete security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy trust-to-untrust
delete interfaces
delete protocols stp
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet
delete system services telnet
delete system services xnm-clear-text
delete system services web-management https interface vlan.0
delete system name-server
commit check
commit
```
You can now go pure console to get the new config up or you can temporarily re-add the SSH and ge-0/0/0 config to facilitate faster 'in-band' config upload as per:
```
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ssh
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services dhcp
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ping
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1
```

## Step 5.

Set clustering on node '0' from operational mode (and verify).
```
set chassis cluster cluster-id 1 node 0 reboot
```
then set clustering on node 'a1' from operational mode (and verify).
```
set chassis cluster cluster-id 1 node 1 reboot
```

## Step 6. 

Dump up your actual clustered configuration however make sure you remove the last pieces of the old config:
```
delete interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0
delete interfaces ge-0/0/6
delete interfaces ge-0/0/7
delete system services dhcp propagate-settings ge-0/0/0.0
```

## Step 7.

Test your cluster (and the cluster/HA LED lights should be green!)
```
show chassis cluster status
```
Check the config on the second node from the first:
```
request routing-engine login node 1
```
Remove alarms and ensure a 'rescue' config:
```
set chassis alarm management-ethernet link-down ignore
commit check
commit
run request system configuration rescue save
run show configuration | display set
```

## Bonus

Loading a locally prepared config in 'set' mode. Create or update the config on a unix text editor and ensure there are no hidden and extra CR+LF characters, then use the ```load set``` command as per [http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/src4.0/topics/concept/src-configuration-commands-load.html](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/src4.0/topics/concept/src-configuration-commands-load.html). Some of us are old school Cisco peeps…

Ctrl+D ends the input when you have successfully typed it all in, and perhaps re-do the hostname and root password again just in case you forgot to change them previously.
```
set system host-name cc-cty-cst-fw02a0
set system root-authentication plain-text-password <CR>
New password:
Retype new password:
```

**Note:** If the config is very long, do it in 250 line stages to save the buffer filling up on your terminal emulation program.
