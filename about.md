## About

This is a project to help individuals and organisations quickly design and build network platforms. The designs should focus on known good patterns and seek to facilitate decision making in relation to design choices, purchasing, and a range of implementation considerations (including the actual configurations and code). These design documents can be a mix of or even a subset of any of the traditional discrete design, project, or configuration artefacts. You may notice that business requirements, technical requirements, solution architectures, high level designs, low level designs, and 'as built' guides (to name a few) can be stripped down and potentially concatenated. With this more open and fleixble approach artefacts can then be fully modularised and even remixed as micro documents more easily. Perhaps one could also conceptualise the project as distrbuted source code management for a design layer above [RFCs(Request For Comments)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html) similar to [BCPs(Best Current Practices)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_current_practice). 

Rather than generate [ITIL](http://www.itil-officialsite.com/AboutITIL/WhatisITIL.aspx) shelfware or [OpenGroup TOGAF](http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/) frameworks we decided to pare things back to to help with decision making, building, testing, and getting things doneâ€¦ cheaper, faster, **and** more reliably.

## Why?

The overall goal however is to catalyse community sharing and accelerated access to free and open data network designs and patterns whilst also empowering groups to contribute back to or help one another easily. Reliable network platforms themselves help communities achieve the best quality access to information and services, and are the foundational underpinning of the experience many of us take for granted. Not all individuals or groups have the same resources or experience thus making a repository such as this free and open will hopefully give anyone and everyone a kick start. (..and perhaps they can then save some additional money and time which can be allocated elsewhere or used to finish that last 20% that rarely gets finessed or polished!)

Networks also require ongoing operational management, instrumentation, and continued optimisation to ensure they are tailored to their specific environment and able to meet the changing demands placed upon them. Even at this management tier there are many common patterns, challenges, and huge bodies of knowledge that still lie untapped which could benefit many.

From discrete web articles and blogs, to all the network operator groups globally, or even to the open/closed forums online, there is no where we are aware of (yet) where individuals or organisations of differing sizes can freely access and update templates, download pre-populated designs, and known good configurations or stanzas.

If we can help to cut out the 'fat' normally found in proprietary and closed system integration documentation whilst uncovering some of the tacit knowledge for a few small projects (be they non-profit, commercial, or otherwise) we will have succeeded. The intent is to share these patterns and recipes far and wide via the FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) ethos and toolsets by capturing patterns and making them easily available to be forked, remixed of shared for the common good. 

## A Note on Risk

As network platforms underpin all digital connectivity (and also accepting that risk is a factor of dependence), one must then conclude that networks pose one of the greatest risks to organisations that rely upon digital fabrics and digital services to operate. Irrespective of vulnerabilities and differing threat actors, there is still room for huge improvement in how networks are designed, built, operated, and continually improved upon. Whether a network is open or closed, contains a large population or not, all networks are subject to entropy (countered only by ectropy).
